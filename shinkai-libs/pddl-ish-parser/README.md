# PDDL-ish Parser

The PDDL-ish Parser is a Rust library designed for parsing a relaxed version of the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This parser is particularly tailored for handling PDDL-like inputs that may be generated by autoregressive language models such as ChatGPT.

## Features

- Parse non-standard PDDL files with flexibility.
- Extract domains, objects, and actions from PDDL-like structured text.
- Error handling to provide context for parsing failures.
- Support for common PDDL constructs with leniency in syntax.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the PDDL-ish Parser:

```rust
use pddl_ish_parser::parser::problem_parser::parse_problem;

fn main() {
    let input = r#"(define (problem your-problem)
        ...
    )"#;

    match parse_problem(input) {
        Ok((_, problem)) => println!("{:?}", problem),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error parsing problem: {:?}", e),
    }

    let domain_input = r#"(define (domain your-domain)
        ...
    )"#;

    match parse_domain_types(domain_input) {
        Ok((_, domain_types)) => println!("Parsed domain types: {:?}", domain_types),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error parsing domain types: {:?}", e),
    }
}
```

## Testing

The library includes tests that you can run to ensure the parser works as expected:

```bash
cargo test
```
