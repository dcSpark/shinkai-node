// This file used to contain structs for the old invoice-based payment system.
// All such structs (Invoice, InvoiceRequest, InvoiceStatusEnum, InvoiceError, etc.)
// have been removed as part of the migration to the x402 payment system.

// If new general (non-x402 specific) payment or invoicing related schemas are needed in the future,
// they can be added here. For x402 specific types, refer to:
// shinkai_libs::shinkai_non_rust_code::functions::x402::types
