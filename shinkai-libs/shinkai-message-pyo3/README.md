## Compile

You can build your Python library with the following command:

`maturin develop`

If you want to build a wheel (.whl) file that you can distribute and install with pip, you can use the following command:

`maturin build`

Before running these commands, make sure you have activated the Python virtual environment where you want to install the library, if you're using one.

## Run Tests

WIP: `python -m unittest`
