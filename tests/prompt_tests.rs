As such it will be important to ensure that the bridges built for the L1 can also be used directly with our L2 to make the developer experience one-to-one, no matter on what layer the zkApp is deployed on. (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [16])\n\n - 12.7 Connect ZK Rollup To Mina Bridges (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [])\n\n - With the latest innovations in the blockchain space pushing towards a rollup-dominant future, Mina has found itself to be positioned in an ideal place to capitalize on all of its upfront ZK work, but now in a new direction. At this point in time ZK Rollups have reached significant mind-share in the blockchain industry as the ideal scaling solution, yet due to the inherent complexity at play, are (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [1])\n\n - The ZK Rollup L2 node will function similarly to an L1 Mina node, however with a few key differences.

Furthermore, this project seeks to strengthen Mina’s strong points by fulfilling the following goals: Increasing the throughput of Mina L1 (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [1])\n\n - 8. Native zkApp execution environment: Developers should be able to reuse zkApp native functional- ities and tooling, as both Mina and the rollup should have equivalent execution environments and not break native smart contracts. 4 Protocol Summary (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [2, 3])\n\n - In order for the ZK Rollup to be sustainable, it must have its own token as an integral part of the fee structure, both for the L2 itself and for the DA layer. These fees map onto work (computation), DA (networking + storage), and other real costs which underlie the functioning of the L2 itself. At a high level, the fees in the system are based off of: (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [12])\n\n - In order to fulfill the above stated goals in the Introduction, this ZK Rollup project intends to adhere to the following requirements: 1. Minimize missing rollup blocks: Mina has a very long block time, and so missing a rollup block (ex: no sequencer elected for that slot) has a large impact on the L2 throughput (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [2])\n\n - Altho (Source: files/Zeko_Mina_Rollup.pdf, Pgs: [18])\n\n ```.\n".to_string()
