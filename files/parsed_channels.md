# Shinkai Vector Resources

A powerful native Rust fully in-memory/serializable Vector Search solution.

A Vector Resource is made up of a hierarchy of nodes, where each node can either hold a piece of `Text` or another `Vector Resource`.

## Importing Into Your Project

To disable [desktop-only](https://www.shinkai.com/) & support ![wasm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/WebAssembly_Logo.svg/1200px-WebAssembly_Logo.svg.png), simply import <b>as such<b>:

```
shinkai_vector_resources = { path = "../shinkai-vector-resources", default-features = false }
```

## How To Use Vector Resources

Reference `vector_resource_tests.rs` to see the examples of the basic flow of:

1. Ingesting a source document (pdf/txt/epub/...) into a Vector Resource
2. Generating a query
3. Performing a vector search on the resource using the query
4. Examining results

Reference `vector_resource_tests.rs` to see examples of how to use advanced capabilities such as:

- Differences between DocumentVectorResource vs. MapVectorResource
- How pathing works through the hierarchy (and making searches starting at arbitrary paths)
- Different TaversalMethods available when making a Vector Search
- Syntactic Vector Searches
- Manual Vector Resource building (including manual hierarchy building)
