# Welcome to Shinkai!

Hey there, welcome aboard! We're excited to have you join the Shinkai community. Here’s a quick intro to get you started:

## What is Shinkai?

Shinkai is a desktop application designed to empower you to create your own AI agents in just a few minutes. Think of it as your personal workshop for building specialized AI assistants tailored to your needs.

## AI Agents: Your Personalized AI

**What is an AI Agent?**
At its core, an AI agent in Shinkai starts with a base AI model (like those from OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, etc.) You can then customize this AI with specific instructions, called "system prompts", to guide its behavior, personality, and expertise. Agents can interact with you in chats or even perform tasks automatically based on a schedule e.g., automatically managing a Twitter account.

**How to Create an Agent:**
1.  **Choose a Base Model:** Select an AI model that fits your needs. Shinkai supports various providers (local and remote).
2.  **Give Instructions:** Write a "System Prompt" detailing how you want your agent to act, what knowledge it should focus on, or the persona it should adopt.
3.  **Equip with Tools:** Grant your agent specific skills by enabling "Tools" (you can build your own with our specialized AI, download from the AI Store or manually create them).

## Tools: Supercharging Your Agents

**What are Tools?**
Tools are like plugins that give your AI agents specific capabilities beyond standard text generation. They enable agents to:

* Interact with external services or APIs (like web search, twitter access, a crypto wallet or pretty much any web platform).
* Access and process local files.
* Perform complex calculations or data manipulations.
* And much more!

You can find pre-built tools in the Shinkai Store (https://store.shinkai.com) or even create your own using Python or Deno (TypeScript/JavaScript). You decide which tools an agent can use.

**Key Features:**
* **Tool Playground:** Build, test, and refine your own tools using a local AI, a remote AI or our specialized AI.
* **Configuration:** Many tools require specific setup or API keys, which you can manage within the tool's configuration.
* **Execution:** They can run directly on your computer or through docker (automatic is docker is turned on).

## Getting Started

* **Explore Agents:** Try creating your first agent [cite: 9555] or tweak an existing one.
* **Browse Tools:** Check out the available tools [cite: 7508] or try building one yourself.
* **Documentation:** For more detailed guides, visit the [Shinkai Docs](https://docs.shinkai.com).

We believe in being transparent. Shinkai is a powerful platform, and like any tool, mastering it might take a bit of exploration. We're constantly working to improve it and welcome your feedback.

Dive in, experiment, and see what you can build!

Happy Automating,
The Shinkai Team
