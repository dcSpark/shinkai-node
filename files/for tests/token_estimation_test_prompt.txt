4626.68 - 4631.04: subscribe uh we're almost at 500,000,
4601.92 - 4605.92: Chris and Spencer did an amazing job the 
4604.24 - 4608.32: team over there from good future media 
4605.92 - 4609.96: of creating just that amazing fan 
4608.32 - 4611.96: account now that we're growing up here 
4609.96 - 4615.04: over at Allin and we'll have a CEO 
4611.96 - 4616.52: announcement at some point we have taken,
4589.16 - 4593.24: you get paid and the and then they don't 
4591.28 - 4596.08: let you go to a competitor that's why 
4593.24 - 4597.72: both of them are doing internet stuff X 
4596.08 - 4599.24: or whatever carved out stuff just wanted 
4597.72 - 4601.92: to give a shout out here at the end of 
4599.24 - 4604.24: the Pod for the guys at all in talk,
4576.44 - 4579.40: happened I think with Tucker they both 
4577.84 - 4581.60: got paid their full contracts whoever 
4579.40 - 4583.08: negotiates those contracts with the 
4581.60 - 4586.36: networks over the last couple of decades 
4583.08 - 4589.16: is awesome because it's pay it's pay for 
4586.36 - 4591.28: play like whether you are on air or not,
4560.92 - 4565.44: they don't exist anymore like Tucker and 
4563.00 - 4568.08: him were like the last of that 
4565.44 - 4571.52: generation to get those huge payday over 
4568.08 - 4574.44: Don Lemon got paid $30 million by whom I 
4571.52 - 4576.44: think CNN the report was CNN paid out 
4574.44 - 4577.84: his full contract the same thing,
4548.36 - 4551.72: something that he can twist into 
4549.88 - 4553.68: something that it doesn't mean and he 
4551.72 - 4556.20: can say I got Elon Musk then he can get 
4553.68 - 4558.80: his job back at CNN or one of those he 
4556.20 - 4560.92: got paid out in full like 20 30 million 
4558.80 - 4563.00: bucks and by the way those jobs are not,
4535.00 - 4538.28: thought it was really getting 
4536.76 - 4539.84: interesting at moments in time he's 
4538.28 - 4542.88: obviously trying to get a job back at 
4539.84 - 4545.72: some mainstream Media Company maybe this 
4542.88 - 4548.36: is his this is his resume if he can 
4545.72 - 4549.88: basically get some clip of Elon saying,
4521.96 - 4525.72: Sensational gotcha journalism and it was 
4524.08 - 4527.24: a totally wasted opportunity if he had 
4525.72 - 4529.92: just Don Lemon had just stayed in the 
4527.24 - 4532.08: moment and like engaged in good faith 
4529.92 - 4534.00: instead of trying to get this like clip 
4532.08 - 4535.00: it was it really bad performance by Don 
4534.00 - 4536.76: LM and I,
4510.56 - 4514.88: constantly trying to do a gotta 
4512.28 - 4516.28: journalism thing and Elon was trying to 
4514.88 - 4518.12: engage in good faith and like an 
4516.28 - 4520.20: interesting discussion and then every 
4518.12 - 4521.96: time the discussion got interesting he 
4520.20 - 4524.08: kept trying to go back to like,
4497.28 - 4501.56: it's also nuts like C that Don Lemon 
4500.24 - 4503.52: interview like there was actually some 
4501.56 - 4505.44: really interesting topics discussed but 
4503.52 - 4508.28: I I felt like this was like this was the 
4505.44 - 4510.56: perfect like baton passing between old 
4508.28 - 4512.28: media and and New Media where he was,
4482.64 - 4488.72: best weeks of his life yeah Starship 
4485.96 - 4490.76: three made it up yeah Starship had an 
4488.72 - 4493.32: incredible performance last week and 
4490.76 - 4495.24: then this thing this week I mean what an 
4493.32 - 4497.28: incredible 7-Day run it's more than most 
4495.24 - 4500.24: of us will have in our lifetime it's,
4469.24 - 4473.12: this was really cool you know it's so 
4471.32 - 4476.96: funny it's like people are breathlessly 
4473.12 - 4478.48: like looking at the Elon Don Lemon video 
4476.96 - 4480.68: and they're trying to opine whether he 
4478.48 - 4482.64: had a good interview or a bad interview 
4480.68 - 4485.96: and it's like he actually had one of the,
4454.88 - 4460.80: coming year they're getting it done it's 
4458.12 - 4462.52: for FKS my kids were really Blown Away 
4460.80 - 4465.48: by it you know it's it's interesting to 
4462.52 - 4467.64: me what like penetrates their cynicism 
4465.48 - 4469.24: and like what they get actually 
4467.64 - 4471.32: impressed or excited by and they thought,
4439.76 - 4444.48: there I was talking to somebody who 
4441.36 - 4446.76: works there and you know it's it's it's 
4444.48 - 4449.48: going to 
4446.76 - 4451.32: be yeah it's it's going to be a process 
4449.48 - 4453.16: but they're making significant Pro 
4451.32 - 4454.88: progress and they're going to have I 
4453.16 - 4458.12: think even bigger announcements in the,
4425.60 - 4430.32: incredible I mean it's that they kind of 
4428.60 - 4432.92: went public with it or I mean obviously 
4430.32 - 4435.56: he agreed to go public with it I think 
4432.92 - 4438.00: Trevor is his name it's pretty amazing 
4435.56 - 4439.76: and there's more amazing stuff coming 
4438.00 - 4441.36: they're making significant progress over,
4414.44 - 4417.36: he loves chess he wasn't able to play 
4415.92 - 4419.20: chess now he's able to play chess he was 
4417.36 - 4421.00: able to play Civilization the game which 
4419.20 - 4423.60: I guess was really 
4421.00 - 4425.60: hard in the absence of having this this 
4423.60 - 4428.60: chip and now he can do that it's it's,
4400.88 - 4405.44: playing chess and I've learned to use my 
4402.80 - 4407.64: mind to move pieces around and he said 
4405.44 - 4409.92: like it's like having the force I mean 
4407.64 - 4411.48: totally wow amazing I watched the live 
4409.92 - 4414.44: stream and he said that he was a 
4411.48 - 4415.92: quadriplegic from the shoulders down but,
4386.00 - 4390.80: speaking of medical breakthroughs did 
4388.56 - 4391.84: you guys see the the guy who got the 
4390.80 - 4394.32: neuralink 
4391.84 - 4396.92: chip chess with his brain he's using the 
4394.32 - 4399.16: force yeah that was awesome using the 
4396.92 - 4400.88: force yeah he described it as he was 
4399.16 - 4402.80: playing chess and he said like I love,
4366.60 - 4373.40: now use this effectively Infinite Source 
4370.76 - 4376.72: of 
4373.40 - 4378.96: organs seems really 
4376.72 - 4380.52: compelling pretty amazing I don't know 
4378.96 - 4383.56: what do you 
4380.52 - 4386.00: think definitely where we're headed I 
4383.56 - 4388.56: don't even think they're gonna need yeah,
4352.72 - 4357.16: six hours trying to basically you have a 
4355.72 - 4359.52: machine that does the job the kidneys 
4357.16 - 4360.96: for you to keep your blood clean but 
4359.52 - 4363.24: it's just it's kind of a death sentence 
4360.96 - 4365.52: and it's like a slow moving death 
4363.24 - 4366.60: sentence at that so the idea that you 
4365.52 - 4370.76: could,
4336.52 - 4340.92: doing well it's really incredible and 
4338.28 - 4344.20: this is a guy that was at end stage 
4340.92 - 4346.16: kidney disease and my father went 
4344.20 - 4348.64: through this but when you're at that 
4346.16 - 4352.72: endstage renal disease you're getting 
4348.64 - 4355.72: dialed every 3 days for up to four five,
4321.12 - 4327.16: used crisper casine to edit out the 
4325.16 - 4329.16: certain subset of the pig genes and edit 
4327.16 - 4331.04: in a certain useful subset of human 
4329.16 - 4333.76: genes and then they transplanted that 
4331.04 - 4336.52: kidney into a 64 year old 
4333.76 - 4338.28: man I and he apparently seems to be,
4306.08 - 4309.56: of the universe so super kind of 
4307.80 - 4311.80: interesting confirmatory data from James 
4309.56 - 4315.76: wed this week Jam do you want to talk 
4311.80 - 4317.84: about the the the pig kidney I mean I 
4315.76 - 4321.12: think it's it's really incredible they 
4317.84 - 4325.16: took a kidney from a pig and then they,
4294.60 - 4298.40: explanations for why this might be 
4295.96 - 4300.32: happening but it's kind of a big story 
4298.40 - 4302.44: because it basically confirms that we 
4300.32 - 4303.68: see a lot of differential expansion 
4302.44 - 4306.08: happening Across the Universe and we 
4303.68 - 4307.80: don't know why just another big mystery,
4284.36 - 4287.64: on there's almost a little bubble and on 
4286.36 - 4289.32: the outside of the bubble there's 
4287.64 - 4290.80: galaxies and they're pulling stuff out 
4289.32 - 4292.64: faster than what's happening where 
4290.80 - 4294.60: there's not as much density so there's a 
4292.64 - 4295.96: lot of different reasons and and,
4271.68 - 4275.04: understand about this large scale 
4273.20 - 4277.00: structure of the universe and why these 
4275.04 - 4279.08: things are happening there was one group 
4277.00 - 4281.12: that put out a theory where they said 
4279.08 - 4284.36: that the local Universe where we see 
4281.12 - 4286.36: these seph stars that this data is based,
4260.92 - 4264.04: different parts of the universe should 
4262.68 - 4265.40: be expanding at a different rate than 
4264.04 - 4267.64: other parts of the universe that there's 
4265.40 - 4269.72: differential expansion happening Across 
4267.64 - 4271.68: the Universe and it really tells us that 
4269.72 - 4273.20: there's very little we know or,
4249.48 - 4253.52: the universe which totally doesn't make 
4251.48 - 4255.56: sense and there's no really clear answer 
4253.52 - 4257.64: as to the physics of why if there was a 
4255.56 - 4259.40: big bang and the universe started to 
4257.64 - 4260.92: expand it should be expanding the same 
4259.40 - 4262.68: everywhere there's no reason that,
4235.20 - 4240.52: didn't match the value that we see when 
4236.96 - 4243.20: we look at exploding Stars very far away 
4240.52 - 4244.80: and so it once again confirms what the 
4243.20 - 4247.20: original Hubble data showed which is 
4244.80 - 4249.48: that the universe is expanding at 
4247.20 - 4251.48: different rates in different parts of,
4222.48 - 4226.56: rate of expansion of the universe and 
4224.72 - 4229.24: what this sh star showed is that the 
4226.56 - 4231.00: rate of expansion of the universe as 
4229.24 - 4232.80: measured across a thousand of these 
4231.00 - 4235.20: Stars called sehid stars in five 
4232.80 - 4236.96: different galaxies had a value that,
4209.00 - 4213.84: resolution of Imaging and as a result 
4211.52 - 4215.08: much better data and here's an image of 
4213.84 - 4217.72: it you can just see the difference 
4215.08 - 4219.52: between what came out of James web and 
4217.72 - 4222.48: what was used in Hubble so that shows 
4219.52 - 4224.72: one star that was used to calculate the,
4195.04 - 4198.12: thought from the Supernova that we saw 
4197.00 - 4199.72: and everyone thought there was something 
4198.12 - 4202.60: wrong with the Hubble Space Telescope 
4199.72 - 4206.80: data so you know in a final print 
4202.60 - 4209.00: published last month the James web Space 
4206.80 - 4211.52: Telescope which showed much higher,
4180.92 - 4184.40: data was that recently we saw that 
4182.80 - 4186.72: different types of 
4184.40 - 4187.92: stars that were observed with the Hubble 
4186.72 - 4190.68: Space 
4187.92 - 4193.36: Telescope had actually a 
4190.68 - 4195.04: different rate of expansion of the 
4193.36 - 4197.00: universe than what was previously,
4169.80 - 4172.84: like you know we're all in the middle of 
4171.36 - 4175.08: the universe and the universe is moving 
4172.84 - 4177.44: away from us it's that the entire 
4175.08 - 4179.00: entirety of space is expanding itself 
4177.44 - 4180.92: and so everything is moving away from 
4179.00 - 4182.80: everything else the challenge in the,
4155.72 - 4159.72: and they're all moving apart from each 
4157.00 - 4163.52: other so the distance between everything 
4159.72 - 4166.80: is getting wider space is 
4163.52 - 4168.28: expanding Central moment the Big Bang 
4166.80 - 4169.80: that's the theory is right this all 
4168.28 - 4171.36: started in the Big Bang and it's not,
4142.96 - 4147.04: expanding meaning that everything is 
4145.32 - 4149.32: moving away from itself it's almost as 
4147.04 - 4150.72: if we're all in a cake the best analogy 
4149.32 - 4153.60: I've heard is that there's raisins in 
4150.72 - 4155.72: the cake and as the cake expands in the 
4153.60 - 4157.00: oven all of those raisins look around,
4124.64 - 4129.64: light the the the Supernova is moving 
4127.36 - 4133.60: away from us or towards us and how 
4129.64 - 4136.28: quickly and so what scientists have used 
4133.60 - 4138.08: those observations to deduce several 
4136.28 - 4142.96: decades ago and for which a group won 
4138.08 - 4145.32: the Nobel Prize is that our universe is,
4109.48 - 4117.24: observe the brightness of supern noi or 
4114.08 - 4118.68: exploding stars and then by looking at 
4117.24 - 4120.76: their brightness we could tell how far 
4118.68 - 4122.36: away they were and then looking at the 
4120.76 - 4124.64: shift of the light whether it's getting 
4122.36 - 4127.36: red or blue you can tell whether the,
4091.92 - 4097.68: the writer's room to get an update on 
4093.56 - 4100.32: the Uranus jokes it's long been known 
4097.68 - 4102.48: that our universe is expanding we've all 
4100.32 - 4104.44: heard about the The Big Bang 
4102.48 - 4108.08: Theory 
4104.44 - 4109.48: and couple decades ago scientists began 
4108.08 - 4114.08: to,
4076.44 - 4083.04: my Z is back are we headed for Uranus we 
4080.36 - 4085.08: dead set on it we're 
4083.04 - 4087.92: dead he disappeared again he's just 
4085.08 - 4090.24: gonna drop in and do an Uranus jokes I 
4087.92 - 4091.92: hear him giggling with his camera he's 
4090.24 - 4093.56: with his writers he's he just went to,
4060.56 - 4065.96: definitely red he dropped he dropped I 
4063.88 - 4068.68: love science quarter let's do it 
4065.96 - 4070.96: freeberg it's your time to sign to to 
4068.68 - 4073.76: shine of science tell us what's going on 
4070.96 - 4076.44: with the universe my favorite topic 
4073.76 - 4080.36: astrophysics my favorite top,
4045.96 - 4050.20: go with this I mean do you guys want to 
4047.92 - 4052.60: talk about how the universe is expanding 
4050.20 - 4054.24: at an accelerating rate and expanding 
4052.60 - 4057.28: differentially everywhere we look and we 
4054.24 - 4060.48: don't understand how or why 100% And sax 
4057.28 - 4060.48: needs to use the L so yeah,
4033.32 - 4037.36: going to see some real distress yeah 
4035.64 - 4039.16: including in the regional banking system 
4037.36 - 4040.68: freeberg you had a a science corner here 
4039.16 - 4043.72: a couple of different things came up the 
4040.68 - 4045.96: Hubble telescope 3D 
4043.72 - 4047.92: printed organs what where do you want to,
4018.88 - 4022.88: to 2% and then we'll get these rate cuts 
4021.12 - 4024.96: and they're hoping they can cling on 
4022.88 - 4026.80: landlords are Clinging On And I think 
4024.96 - 4030.00: the banks that loan them all this money 
4026.80 - 4033.32: are clinging on for dear life but if 
4030.00 - 4035.64: rates stay higher longer then you're,
4003.76 - 4008.84: fast enough and occupancy rates will go 
4005.80 - 4012.00: up fast enough that no one has to 
4008.84 - 4013.32: foreclose but if rates don't come down 
4012.00 - 4015.80: then you have a real problem I mean 
4013.32 - 4018.88: again everyone is just assuming that 
4015.80 - 4021.12: inflation will continue its path from 3%,
3992.32 - 3997.28: foreclose and then sell them at a fire 
3994.68 - 3999.52: sale price so yeah everyone is it's 
3997.28 - 4000.72: pretend an extend yeah kicking the can 
3999.52 - 4002.32: down the road nobody wants to take the 
4000.72 - 4003.76: medicine so yeah well they're hoping 
4002.32 - 4005.80: they're hoping that rates will come down,
3976.76 - 3981.12: 10 is that extend and pretend strategy 
3979.32 - 3983.72: that you see in there oh yeah I mean 
3981.12 - 3987.48: only one quarter of the loans got paid 
3983.72 - 3988.72: off so 75% get paid off in full so 
3987.48 - 3992.32: there's tons of buildings that are 
3988.72 - 3994.68: underwater right now but nobody wants to,
3962.04 - 3967.24: article reported that of the 36 billion 
3964.12 - 3969.20: of office loans that came due in the 
3967.24 - 3972.00: commercial mortgage back Securities 
3969.20 - 3974.64: market last year only one quarter were 
3972.00 - 3976.76: paid off in full that's according to 
3974.64 - 3979.32: data from Real Estate analytics fir cred,
3946.12 - 3951.08: Biden I will have to 
3947.76 - 3953.88: agree there look I think the the bigger 
3951.08 - 3955.84: economic issue to be talking about was 
3953.88 - 3958.08: that buried article in the The Wall 
3955.84 - 3960.12: Street Journal about commercial real 
3958.08 - 3962.04: estate do you see that article that was 
3960.12 - 3964.12: crazy so this Wall Street Journal,
3933.36 - 3939.00: it is but pal comes if pal comes through 
3936.40 - 3940.76: with the ray cuts that will help him 
3939.00 - 3942.28: it's pretty amazing how horrible a job 
3940.76 - 3944.36: he's doing that he's made Trump look 
3942.28 - 3946.12: like a better candidate to some people 
3944.36 - 3947.76: that is an extraordinary achievement by,
3921.32 - 3926.20: and the stock market certainly doing 
3922.64 - 3927.88: pretty well a president with the these 
3926.20 - 3930.28: fundamentals would normally get 
3927.88 - 3931.88: reelected but Biden currently is not his 
3930.28 - 3933.36: polling is not the polling of a 
3931.88 - 3936.40: president who's going to get reelected,
3904.44 - 3910.16: Victory freedberg what do you 
3907.08 - 3913.36: think about the risk 
3910.16 - 3915.12: on I don't know Biden is incredibly 
3913.36 - 3917.76: unpopular if you look at his actual 
3915.12 - 3919.68: polling he should not win the election 
3917.76 - 3921.32: but that's in spite of you're right the 
3919.68 - 3922.64: economy is seems to be doing pretty well,
3888.32 - 3894.08: going into this year is that yeah get a 
3891.64 - 3896.12: Biden put from the FED absolutely and 
3894.08 - 3897.92: it's looking like Biden has a clear path 
3896.12 - 3900.20: to Victory based on the lowest 
3897.92 - 3902.08: unemployment of our lifetimes and this 
3900.20 - 3904.44: roaring stock market 
3902.08 - 3907.08: records yeah it's just a easy Biden,
3873.20 - 3877.40: rhetoric yesterday and they seem to 
3876.16 - 3878.40: think that that means that the ray cuts 
3877.40 - 3881.04: are definitely 
3878.40 - 3882.64: coming I don't know how pal can promise 
3881.04 - 3886.16: that without inflation coming down 
3882.64 - 3888.32: unless he's trying to create a Biden put 
3886.16 - 3891.64: there it is folks which was my theory,
3856.72 - 3862.16: 3.1% so it's been sticky around 3% it 
3860.24 - 3864.88: was coming down pretty fast last year 
3862.16 - 3866.80: but it's still there so people I think 
3864.88 - 3868.28: are Maybe gambling in the sense that 
3866.80 - 3873.20: they're counting on R cuts that haven't 
3868.28 - 3876.16: happened yet but they liked Pal's doish,
3843.12 - 3847.16: certainty that you're going to get three 
3844.44 - 3849.60: rate Cuts this year and it still seems 
3847.16 - 3852.84: to me that that's a little bit up in the 
3849.60 - 3854.76: air because inflation has not come down 
3852.84 - 3856.72: to the fed's Target of 2% it's still 
3854.76 - 3860.24: right around 3%,
3828.96 - 3834.28: concern you I guess after what we just 
3831.76 - 3835.80: experienced well I think they're pricing 
3834.28 - 3837.40: in these rate Cuts as if they're 
3835.80 - 3839.88: definitely going to happen like jamas 
3837.40 - 3843.12: said I think the the Market's 
3839.88 - 3844.44: expectation is with let's call it 70%,
3813.80 - 3817.84: the beginning of the beginning in terms 
3815.32 - 3819.92: of that kind of speculation yeah we saw 
3817.84 - 3822.44: crypto go bonkers the last couple of 
3819.92 - 3826.48: weeks yeah what's your take on all this 
3822.44 - 3828.96: Sachs is does it feel like people are in 
3826.48 - 3831.76: h gamble mode again and does that,
3798.04 - 3802.56: it probably means that we'll get another 
3799.92 - 3805.24: 50 to 75 basis points through 2025 so 
3802.56 - 3806.76: people will look out to the end of 2025 
3805.24 - 3809.56: and look at a fed funds rate that's sort 
3806.76 - 3813.80: of like 375 to 4% so they're getting 
3809.56 - 3815.32: pretty excited and froed up so this is,
3780.64 - 3786.00: stock price will be tomorrow generally 
3783.96 - 3788.52: way sorry the the other thing is like 
3786.00 - 3789.76: Powell did say finally it looks pretty 
3788.52 - 3792.52: likely we're going to get these three 
3789.76 - 3794.40: Cuts so we're going to be down to four 
3792.52 - 3798.04: and a half to 
3794.40 - 3799.92: 475 on fed funds by the end of the year,
3767.88 - 3773.12: of it but whenever these things are so 
3771.04 - 3775.28: mispriced just means that people are are 
3773.12 - 3776.88: ready to gamble a little bit there's 
3775.28 - 3779.08: definitely a lot of gambling in the 
3776.88 - 3780.64: system as we've seen and we're recording 
3779.08 - 3783.96: this on Thursday so who knows what the,
3751.60 - 3757.40: go we're in the middle of another meme 
3754.08 - 3759.60: coin craze oh God don't bring it up we 
3757.40 - 3762.24: all getting pulled into that nonsense I 
3759.60 - 3765.64: think the point is that I think there is 
3762.24 - 3767.88: a speculative party going on right now 
3765.64 - 3771.04: and I'm not saying that Reddit is part,
3735.16 - 3741.36: popping 50% on the first 
3738.04 - 3743.36: day I don't know I really haven't looked 
3741.36 - 3744.84: at the company I haven't looked at the 
3743.36 - 3747.52: the 
3744.84 - 3749.20: financials but like these last three or 
3747.52 - 3751.60: four weeks I think people have been so 
3749.20 - 3754.08: excited and rearing to,
3719.72 - 3725.68: they have 800 million in Revenue company 
3721.96 - 3728.56: is worth over 8 billion dollar in 
3725.68 - 3730.60: trading it's up 50% what do you think 
3728.56 - 3733.56: chamath is this the opening of the IPO 
3730.60 - 3735.16: window again so a oneoff we got stripe 
3733.56 - 3738.04: coming and what do you take from it,
3707.68 - 3711.44: best way to generate a return on $40 
3709.52 - 3713.32: billion if this is where you want to be 
3711.44 - 3715.08: investing I don't think yeah 800 million 
3713.32 - 3717.32: could pay for a lot of credits which 
3715.08 - 3719.72: probably gets you once closer to the to 
3717.32 - 3721.96: the answer or rdit went public today,
3692.92 - 3697.28: gives you a result this is why comp this 
3695.56 - 3699.56: is why like Saudi needs to basically 
3697.28 - 3702.52: make a bet that there's just developers 
3699.56 - 3704.76: that are swarming around ideas let them 
3702.52 - 3707.68: show you what's happening because paying 
3704.76 - 3709.52: 800 million a year of fees is not the,
3683.04 - 3687.52: mean the idea that you would just talk 
3685.08 - 3689.12: to a computer or in a chat interface and 
3687.52 - 3690.36: you wouldn't use an app interface you 
3689.12 - 3691.60: would just ask it questions it would 
3690.36 - 3692.92: give you answers ask a questions it 
3691.60 - 3695.56: gives you answers give it a task it,
3669.72 - 3673.68: kind of the Legacy things that we all 
3671.32 - 3675.68: know and trust also get rebuilt and so 
3673.68 - 3677.96: that could create an entire wave where 
3675.68 - 3680.68: networking value gets recreated and 
3677.96 - 3683.04: everything so so my gosh I mean it could 
3680.68 - 3685.08: be very very transformational yeah I,
3658.28 - 3662.60: need to work that way so I don't exactly 
3660.88 - 3664.16: know what that means but it it just 
3662.60 - 3665.44: seems like most of the architecture of 
3664.16 - 3667.72: how the internet works today doesn't 
3665.44 - 3669.72: make much sense so that would then 
3667.72 - 3671.32: support free br's point that all of the,
3643.04 - 3648.36: you essentially basically have these 
3645.36 - 3651.36: client server apps where you have all of 
3648.36 - 3653.96: this business logic that's sitting back 
3651.36 - 3655.52: in some server somewhere and I don't 
3653.96 - 3658.28: think that that's how apps get built 
3655.52 - 3660.88: today in a world of AI and so it doesn't,
3629.56 - 3633.76: well and then who 
3631.72 - 3635.56: knows the thing that we're not talking 
3633.76 - 3638.52: about enough and I don't understand it 
3635.56 - 3641.20: well enough is the entire way in which 
3638.52 - 3643.04: apps are built needs to fundamentally be 
3641.20 - 3645.36: rethought from first principles because,
3616.44 - 3620.32: bookended in my mind I think the the 
3618.56 - 3622.52: folks that are building fundamental 
3620.32 - 3624.04: Hardware will make a lot of money over 
3622.52 - 3626.48: the next 5 to 10 years and then the 
3624.04 - 3627.96: folks that are building 
3626.48 - 3629.56: the fundamental application Level 
3627.96 - 3631.72: experiences will make a lot of money as,
3603.20 - 3607.80: this robotic space which has been a 
3604.92 - 3609.32: false start over and over and over again 
3607.80 - 3612.48: I think this is the time where actually 
3609.32 - 3615.24: it's going to work and so I'm I I love 
3612.48 - 3616.44: that Hardware robotic space for I think 
3615.24 - 3618.56: you're right SX I think it's kind of,
3590.00 - 3593.64: so I would go with the cloud level for 
3591.96 - 3596.12: those open source models and providing 
3593.64 - 3598.64: that as a service like VMware does or 
3596.12 - 3600.68: other folks do WordPress would be a tiny 
3598.64 - 3603.20: example of an open source project like 
3600.68 - 3604.92: that and then I just something tells me,
3576.72 - 3581.52: cloud and azures so there's an 
3579.36 - 3584.80: opportunity for somebody to compete with 
3581.52 - 3586.80: those incumbents by just being better at 
3584.80 - 3588.12: those models that are open source and 
3586.80 - 3590.00: having the team that's doing those 
3588.12 - 3591.96: updates and then optimizing that cloud,
3562.24 - 3566.36: development of these various Niche 
3564.44 - 3568.36: models is going to be a huge opportunity 
3566.36 - 3570.92: so just once again those open source 
3568.36 - 3573.36: models being put into cloud computing 
3570.92 - 3576.72: environments and optimized that could be 
3573.36 - 3579.36: a whole new level of aws's and Google,
3548.56 - 3554.12: crowded as well and the application 
3550.68 - 3555.56: Level is yet to sort of be built out 
3554.12 - 3557.56: right because we're in year zero or year 
3555.56 - 3559.20: one of that so I do think application 
3557.56 - 3562.24: Level is where there's a lot of value 
3559.20 - 3564.44: but I also think the hosting and the,
3537.00 - 3541.76: another way to answer your question saxs 
3539.28 - 3543.36: is which is the most CR which spaces are 
3541.76 - 3544.96: the most crowded already and so 
3543.36 - 3546.52: obviously chips are super crowded lots 
3544.96 - 3548.56: of incumbents lots of people going after 
3546.52 - 3550.68: it and the foundation models are very,
3524.64 - 3528.40: answer is at the application level level 
3526.68 - 3529.84: yeah and then within application Level 
3528.40 - 3532.28: you could divide it up between existing 
3529.84 - 3535.00: companies and startups yeah and existing 
3532.28 - 3537.00: companies are able to leverage AI 
3535.00 - 3539.28: innovations that are lower in the stack,
3512.12 - 3514.88: going to benefit the the most and I 
3513.72 - 3517.24: think that's probably where most of the 
3514.88 - 3519.20: value will acre is not necessarily a 
3517.24 - 3520.96: chip company but in other businesses in 
3519.20 - 3524.64: traditional industries that can 
3520.96 - 3526.68: transform themselves using AI so your,
3498.44 - 3501.76: there's an incredible set of advances 
3500.20 - 3502.68: are going to be realized in things like 
3501.76 - 3504.84: chemical 
3502.68 - 3507.16: manufacturing drugs General 
3504.84 - 3509.64: manufacturing that have existing scale 
3507.16 - 3512.12: and infrastructure that are the fastest 
3509.64 - 3513.72: to move to adopt these Technologies are,
3486.48 - 3490.00: businesses in traditional industries 
3488.68 - 3491.44: that are going to be able to leverage 
3490.00 - 3494.76: these tools whether they're using open 
3491.44 - 3496.32: source tools or third party technology 
3494.76 - 3498.44: capabilities that they're buying as a 
3496.32 - 3500.20: service or as a piece of software,
3473.36 - 3477.88: foundation model companies the INF 
3476.20 - 3479.64: structure companies or the or the 
3477.88 - 3481.04: applications I'll actually change my 
3479.64 - 3482.92: answer in a little bit I don't think 
3481.04 - 3484.84: it's necessarily new technology 
3482.92 - 3486.48: companies per se that are going to 
3484.84 - 3488.68: benefit most but I think that it's,
3461.88 - 3465.52: actually I'm curious you guys since 
3463.76 - 3467.20: everyone kind of seems to agree with the 
3465.52 - 3469.56: the framework of the four levels of the 
3467.20 - 3470.88: stack where do you guys think the value 
3469.56 - 3473.36: cap is going to be do you think it's 
3470.88 - 3476.20: going to be by the chip companies the,
3445.12 - 3450.40: there should be the Saudi 
3447.28 - 3452.32: for future Equity I love it that's what 
3450.40 - 3456.40: right well there you have it MBS the 
3452.32 - 3458.40: Allin KSA $40 billion fund give us a 
3456.40 - 3461.88: call we'll fire it up and we'll deploy 
3458.40 - 3463.76: the 40 billion for you I kid maybe,
3427.36 - 3431.16: somewhere in a cloud and all of that 
3429.20 - 3434.04: compute will need to be paid for so 
3431.16 - 3437.96: Saudi Arabia should pay for that compute 
3434.04 - 3441.44: get six or s% UPF front and retitle the 
3437.96 - 3445.12: safe not as the what is a safe called 
3441.44 - 3447.28: Jason simple agreement for future Equity,
3412.88 - 3416.32: trillion dollars if it was set up that 
3414.64 - 3419.52: way but the key is to get the credits 
3416.32 - 3422.36: out to people so that the reality is 
3419.52 - 3424.68: what the commonality across every single 
3422.36 - 3427.36: AI startup is that they will have to run 
3424.68 - 3429.20: on a model and that model will be hosted,
3399.80 - 3403.04: a billion and a half to the hardware a 
3401.44 - 3404.28: billion and a half to infrastructure a 
3403.04 - 3405.48: billion and a half to some of these 
3404.28 - 3408.24: discrete 
3405.48 - 3410.36: ideas you probably need a 30 or 40 
3408.24 - 3412.88: person team total no 
3410.36 - 3414.64: more but that business can could make a,
3383.64 - 3390.88: protein synthesis passes that that pass 
3387.40 - 3393.52: whatever it is so now you've scoped the 
3390.88 - 3395.20: problem to 20 billion is in reserves 15 
3393.52 - 3396.84: billion of it is tied up in credits and 
3395.20 - 3399.80: then the five billion I do think it's 
3396.84 - 3401.44: what David said what saak said which is,
3371.44 - 3375.92: robot's dexterity or Vision or 
3373.48 - 3377.28: manipulation or tax completion rate if 
3375.92 - 3379.00: it's a search engine it's a different 
3377.28 - 3381.76: thing if it's a consumer facing app it 
3379.00 - 3383.64: could be users if it's a drug Discovery 
3381.76 - 3387.40: app it's the number of legitimate,
3355.60 - 3359.32: of people whose job it is and you can 
3357.84 - 3362.80: probably train a model to do this as 
3359.32 - 3365.80: well to ingest the reporting in a 
3362.80 - 3367.68: systematic way to understand if it is as 
3365.80 - 3371.44: you guys said a robotics company there 
3367.68 - 3373.48: are measures of the quality of a robo A,
3337.00 - 3344.36: want to run mistol on gcp great if you 
3340.28 - 3346.16: want to run open AI on open AI fantastic 
3344.36 - 3349.00: but we will pay for all the compute in 
3346.16 - 3351.00: return we get 7% up front and you have 
3349.00 - 3352.44: to tell us some Benchmark of how this 
3351.00 - 3355.60: model is 
3352.44 - 3357.84: improving and then you are hiring a team,
3319.56 - 3326.60: gpus so that I could tell any startup in 
3322.36 - 3329.20: the world you will do a safe with me the 
3326.60 - 3332.20: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia I will give you 
3329.20 - 3334.12: free compute on pick your cloud provider 
3332.20 - 3337.00: pick your model I don't care so if you 
3334.12 - 3340.28: want to run llama on grock great if you,
3301.96 - 3307.08: that are winning so that you can make 
3303.44 - 3310.52: the most money of that 20 billion I 
3307.08 - 3312.96: would probably take 2third of it and I 
3310.52 - 3315.48: would go to all the hyperscalers and 
3312.96 - 3317.72: anybody that's providing Cloud compute 
3315.48 - 3319.56: and essentially buy out all of the 
3317.72 - 3322.36: compute credits on,
3290.12 - 3294.88: total fund size for reserves so take 20 
3292.48 - 3295.92: billion off the table and now you have a 
3294.88 - 3297.96: smaller problem which is how do you 
3295.92 - 3300.16: deploy 20 billion because the other 20 
3297.96 - 3301.96: billion is purely meant for the winners 
3300.16 - 3303.44: where you cram the money into the few,
3277.44 - 3281.88: when I didn't have enough Reserve to do 
3279.80 - 3283.20: the full prata or even super prata and 
3281.88 - 3284.96: the ones that worked so the first thing 
3283.20 - 3287.40: you have to do and when I do the 
3284.96 - 3290.12: regression on all of my funds you really 
3287.40 - 3292.48: need to reserve between 40 and 50% of a,
3261.56 - 3265.56: Arabia's public investment fund the most 
3263.68 - 3268.08: important thing that fund managers get 
3265.56 - 3272.04: wrong is not having appropriate reserves 
3268.08 - 3274.64: for your winners and if I look back the 
3272.04 - 3277.44: real profit dollars that I leaked was 
3274.64 - 3279.80: not not investing enough up front but,
3248.36 - 3252.80: employed trth you're batting clean up 
3250.60 - 3254.40: here you got to hear everybody's answers 
3252.80 - 3256.56: before giving your own what are your 
3254.40 - 3258.52: thoughts on your other besties answers 
3256.56 - 3261.56: and what's your plan to deploy 40 
3258.52 - 3263.68: billion for the Kingdom of Saudi,
3235.28 - 3238.80: probably think about deploying it over 
3236.80 - 3240.84: what period of time is it 10 billion a 
3238.80 - 3242.68: year over four years and then is it 
3240.84 - 3245.24: broken apart in what way over those 
3242.68 - 3246.84: sectors and over what geographies and 
3245.24 - 3248.36: you know then find good managers to help 
3246.84 - 3250.60: you get it,
3222.04 - 3226.84: and they could all certainly benefit 
3223.88 - 3229.24: from unlocks in software or in robotics 
3226.84 - 3231.16: and Automation and Hardware so that's 
3229.24 - 3233.84: probably where I would think about 
3231.16 - 3235.28: concentrating Capital but you know 40 
3233.84 - 3236.80: billion is a lot of money so you'd,
3208.60 - 3212.48: high confidence in where things are 
3209.96 - 3213.88: headed there so I do think that we do 
3212.48 - 3215.16: know that there are Enterprise markets 
3213.88 - 3217.52: we know that there are segments of 
3215.16 - 3219.80: things like food 
3217.52 - 3222.04: medicine you know manufacturing these 
3219.80 - 3223.88: are markets that aren't going anywhere,
3195.28 - 3200.76: in chips competing in infrastructure 
3198.12 - 3202.44: competing in models it's such a you know 
3200.76 - 3204.08: as we just talked about with respect to 
3202.44 - 3206.52: what happened with inflection and 
3204.08 - 3208.60: Microsoft this week it's such a rapidly 
3206.52 - 3209.96: changing environment it's hard to have,
3180.28 - 3184.20: and is there a business that's working 
3181.76 - 3186.84: there and that is scalable vertical 
3184.20 - 3189.28: Solutions in labor and Automation and 
3186.84 - 3193.32: productivity gains are probably the best 
3189.28 - 3195.28: sharp ratio good Alpha lower beta and a 
3193.32 - 3198.12: good place to kind of deploy competing,
3166.24 - 3171.36: more traditional business model 
3169.20 - 3172.84: advantages so you know I think your 
3171.36 - 3174.68: point about robotics is a really 
3172.84 - 3177.76: interesting one you know is there a 
3174.68 - 3180.28: Enterprise likee sale of robotics tools 
3177.76 - 3181.76: that have positive Roi for Enterprises,
3152.72 - 3156.64: think saxs the you know it's it's the I 
3154.76 - 3158.68: think the generally accepted framework 
3156.64 - 3159.72: for how to think about how the market is 
3158.68 - 3162.32: broken 
3159.72 - 3164.48: apart but on the application side I 
3162.32 - 3166.24: think is where you could think about 
3164.48 - 3169.20: finding,
3134.64 - 3140.40: robotic companies and then put the AI on 
3136.64 - 3142.64: them and really take a 20-year view of 
3140.40 - 3144.40: Robotics freeberg your thoughts how 
3142.64 - 3147.24: would you deploy the 40 million the 
3144.40 - 3149.92: bottom Three Stacks are are very 
3147.24 - 3152.72: difficult right now to 
3149.92 - 3154.76: find a footing obviously you know I,
3122.12 - 3127.52: like elon's doing with Optimus or figure 
3124.64 - 3129.80: AI is doing with their robot I think 
3127.52 - 3131.16: robotics is a major place you could 
3129.80 - 3132.88: probably buy I don't know who owns 
3131.16 - 3134.64: Boston Dynamics now I know Google sold 
3132.88 - 3136.64: it so you could probably buy some,
3107.04 - 3111.72: deploy money but then I think robotics 
3108.80 - 3114.04: is going to be super super compelling 
3111.72 - 3117.60: here and that takes a lot of money and 
3114.04 - 3119.52: so you do have the capital as a weapon 
3117.60 - 3122.12: and you know the 20-year view of this 
3119.52 - 3124.64: and making a general P purpose robot,
3093.20 - 3097.40: GitHub and hugging face and repet and 
3095.32 - 3098.44: other places where they're active and 
3097.40 - 3101.08: Empower 
3098.44 - 3102.80: those then obviously there's verticals 
3101.08 - 3104.76: we're working on people who are doing 
3102.80 - 3107.04: screenplays and tax just like you are 
3104.76 - 3108.80: sacks and that's a fantastic place to,
3079.44 - 3084.04: tune of you know significant money 50 
3081.96 - 3086.00: million 100 million whatever it takes 
3084.04 - 3088.08: and try to own the top 20 or have 
3086.00 - 3090.80: insights into those top 20 open source 
3088.08 - 3093.20: models and own those teams look for the 
3090.80 - 3095.32: top contributors really easy to do on,
3067.56 - 3071.72: layer and specifically Robotics are huge 
3070.00 - 3073.60: opportunities that are underinvested in 
3071.72 - 3075.36: right now so I would take the top open 
3073.60 - 3077.52: source projects I'd find those top 
3075.36 - 3079.44: contributors take the top 20 or so open 
3077.52 - 3081.96: source projects and back them to the,
3054.20 - 3058.72: fund then I would play at every single 
3056.72 - 3061.08: level and I would hire the best people 
3058.72 - 3063.20: who know each layer of that stack sax 
3061.08 - 3065.84: think you did a good job of sort of 
3063.20 - 3067.56: showing the the four layers of the stack 
3065.84 - 3070.00: I think open source the application,
3043.16 - 3046.04: infrastructure investor I'm more of an 
3044.44 - 3048.12: application investor so I'm going to 
3046.04 - 3049.80: focus on that fourth layer of the stack 
3048.12 - 3051.84: and just trust that there's G to be 
3049.80 - 3054.20: enough value there but again if I was 
3051.84 - 3056.72: managing a $40 billion Sovereign wealth,
3030.04 - 3033.84: at each level of the stack and then who 
3031.40 - 3036.24: are the most promising Challengers and I 
3033.84 - 3038.72: would make a bed at every layer so I'm 
3036.24 - 3041.12: covered that's not what I personally do 
3038.72 - 3043.16: because I'm not you know I'm just not a 
3041.12 - 3044.44: hardware investor I'm not really an,
3016.84 - 3021.28: to capture the most value in the stack I 
3018.68 - 3022.60: mean you could make an argument for 
3021.28 - 3025.00: against pretty much any layer of the 
3022.60 - 3027.32: stack I guess if I had 40 billion to 
3025.00 - 3030.04: deploy what I would do is try to 
3027.32 - 3031.40: identify who are the leading companies,
3007.04 - 3009.96: tools Vector databases things like that 
3009.08 - 3011.84: and then finally you have the 
3009.96 - 3013.64: applications sitting on top of that 
3011.84 - 3014.72: which are just getting started I think 
3013.64 - 3016.84: it's really hard to know from where 
3014.72 - 3018.68: we're seeing today exactly who's going,
2995.56 - 2998.88: the stack first you've got the Silicon 
2997.28 - 3001.20: you've got the chips where Nvidia is 
2998.88 - 3003.28: dominant then you've got the foundation 
3001.20 - 3005.44: models where it's open Ai and then 
3003.28 - 3007.04: there's some open source models and then 
3005.44 - 3009.08: you've got kind of infrastructure Dev,
2985.56 - 2988.64: second in terms of coming up with the 
2986.88 - 2991.12: framework I would think about the 
2988.64 - 2992.24: different levels of the stack of AI and 
2991.12 - 2993.48: try to figure out where the value 
2992.24 - 2995.56: capture is going to be and I think 
2993.48 - 2997.28: there's maybe four different layers of,
2973.52 - 2977.80: Chima well the first thing is I wouldn't 
2975.60 - 2979.24: be in a rush to deploy all 40 billion at 
2977.80 - 2980.56: once because that's a recipe for 
2979.24 - 2982.56: spraying a lot of money into 
2980.56 - 2985.56: unproductive or overhyped things so I 
2982.56 - 2986.88: would take my time first of all but,
2958.36 - 2964.36: allocate the 40 billion in AI in today's 
2962.24 - 2967.20: market 2024 going on if they put you in 
2964.36 - 2969.84: charge of this $40 billion AA fund II 
2967.20 - 2971.44: fund where would you deploy it same 
2969.84 - 2973.52: question would come around the horn to 
2971.44 - 2975.60: you freeberg and then you,
2945.12 - 2949.44: folks in the Middle East region this new 
2947.40 - 2951.48: fund would reportedly invest in AI 
2949.44 - 2954.16: startups chip companies and data 
2951.48 - 2955.92: centers so we thought we'd do a little 
2954.16 - 2958.36: quiz here if you were given the 40 
2955.92 - 2962.24: billion David Sachs how would you,
2932.68 - 2937.32: Saudi have spoken to a number of firms 
2935.36 - 2939.08: about partnering on it the would be the 
2937.32 - 2941.00: second largest Venture fund of all time 
2939.08 - 2943.20: behind soft Banks hundred billion Vision 
2941.00 - 2945.12: fund one which you remember was also 
2943.20 - 2947.40: backed by the Saudis and some other,
2918.84 - 2923.44: kind of the best way to move forward so 
2921.68 - 2925.16: all right there you have it folks in 
2923.44 - 2927.84: other related news the Saudis are 
2925.16 - 2929.88: planning a $40 billion AI fund according 
2927.84 - 2932.68: to the New York Times reps from the 
2929.88 - 2935.36: public investment fund uh in,
2903.20 - 2908.76: of the market where they were 
2905.24 - 2908.76: participating as a startup 
2908.96 - 2913.52: maybe became difficult and untenable and 
2911.48 - 2914.64: negotiations and conversations between 
2913.52 - 2916.88: all these parties who all know each 
2914.64 - 2918.84: other very very well and are all very 
2916.88 - 2921.68: friendly you know this ended up being,
2888.20 - 2892.44: companies there's been a realization on 
2890.68 - 2894.60: how quickly foundational model 
2892.44 - 2897.60: development is commoditizing and how 
2894.60 - 2900.56: quickly costs are escalating and how 
2897.60 - 2903.20: many folks are chasing it so having some 
2900.56 - 2905.24: unique advantage in the particular plane,
2872.72 - 2878.24: faka lunacy or do you think this is a b 
2876.28 - 2880.04: what what's your the the here freeberg 
2878.24 - 2882.12: and what does it say about Microsoft's 
2880.04 - 2885.96: approach to the AI space I don't think 
2882.12 - 2888.20: this is some runaround antitrust I think 
2885.96 - 2890.68: obviously like a lot of,
2856.88 - 2861.32: and it bailed out the investors freeberg 
2859.04 - 2863.12: is that your take this is a bailout or 
2861.32 - 2866.36: do you think this is a new interesting 
2863.12 - 2869.04: end run around antitrust where hey if 
2866.36 - 2872.72: Adobe wants to buy the next figma just 
2869.04 - 2876.28: buy the team do a license of figma some,
2844.08 - 2847.88: going anywhere it had raised hundreds of 
2845.68 - 2849.52: millions of dollars Reed and Bill 
2847.88 - 2852.16: obviously are are wired in they're on 
2849.52 - 2854.60: the Microsoft board and this company did 
2852.16 - 2856.88: have some talent that Microsoft wanted 
2854.60 - 2859.04: so they basically did a giant Aqua hire,
2833.44 - 2838.00: take on this is that this was a bailout 
2836.32 - 2839.40: this was a bailout of the investors I 
2838.00 - 2841.12: don't think the investors got ripped off 
2839.40 - 2842.44: here I think the investors were like 
2841.12 - 2844.08: thrilled to get their money back for 
2842.44 - 2845.68: whatever reason this company wasn't,
2819.96 - 2824.16: away all the talent and then the 
2821.68 - 2827.72: investors get made whole so I think it's 
2824.16 - 2829.12: like an aqua hire with a little bit of 
2854.60 - 2859.04: so they basically did a giant Aqua hire,

2827.72 - 2831.36: tech along with it that they get through 
2829.12 - 2833.44: the licensing deal maybe that's just to 
2831.36 - 2836.32: protect them from an IP standpoint my,
2807.44 - 2810.88: Microsoft to get anything through at

2807.44 - 2810.88: Microsoft to get anything through at 
2808.92 - 2812.88: this point so probably they're just like 
2810.88 - 2815.32: why even deal with the antitrust they 
2812.88 - 2818.20: don't really need the assets so I think 
2815.32 - 2819.96: they licensed the core from the 
2818.20 - 2821.68: inflection C Corp and then they hire,
2793.88 - 2798.56: of the investors of this startup sa no 
2796.76 - 2800.32: conflict no interest right yeah I mean 
2798.56 - 2803.28: we say that a lot this is so weird 
2800.32 - 2805.36: though why not buy the company sax is it 
2803.28 - 2807.44: because of antitrust actually that's a 
2805.36 - 2808.92: good theory it's just it's hard for,
2780.20 - 2784.52: Bill are inexorably tied to Microsoft so 
2783.28 - 2786.40: they were able to get a deal for 
2784.52 - 2788.16: investors that would have never happened 
2786.40 - 2790.88: otherwise and so good on them I think 
2788.16 - 2793.88: they did a very good job protecting the 
2790.88 - 2796.76: fiduciary interests,
2766.80 - 2769.48: remember the same exact kind of thing 
2767.92 - 2772.08: I'll aquire everybody if you don't take 
2769.48 - 2774.52: the deal what is your takee of of what's 
2772.08 - 2777.52: going on here why did this occur like 
2774.52 - 2779.08: this instead of just buying the company 
2777.52 - 2780.20: I mean it occurred like this because 
2779.08 - 2783.28: Reed and,
2753.12 - 2757.88: Equity inflection but I guess that might 
2755.32 - 2759.40: be worthless there's some going on here 
2757.88 - 2761.76: that we don't know about this deal 
2759.40 - 2762.80: structure when you saw this deal and you 
2761.76 - 2765.36: see 
2762.80 - 2766.80: Satia taking the entire team like he 
2765.36 - 2767.92: threatened to do with open AI if you,
2739.04 - 2743.44: bunch of other interesting folks but 
2741.72 - 2746.16: this was a aqua hire which is the weird 
2743.44 - 2747.76: thing chth they hired all the employees 
2746.16 - 2750.52: they leave the shell of a company the 
2747.76 - 2753.12: company's going to go do some Enterprise 
2750.52 - 2755.32: stuff and investors get to keep their,
2725.76 - 2730.08: is a major investor in in this company 
2728.28 - 2732.88: and who's on the board of Microsoft and 
2730.08 - 2734.72: who so LinkedIn to Microsoft played an 
2732.88 - 2737.28: important role in this deal according to 
2734.72 - 2739.04: reports and the inflection investors 
2737.28 - 2741.72: included Bill Gates Eric Schmidt and a,
2711.24 - 2716.72: foundational model like open AI is doing 
2714.56 - 2719.28: like anthropic is doing they had a chat 
2716.72 - 2721.20: bot called Pi very similar to chat GPT 
2719.28 - 2722.92: it was supposed to remember your history 
2721.20 - 2725.76: and build a relationship with you that's 
2722.92 - 2728.28: all getting shut down Reed Hoffman who,
2698.32 - 2701.84: it's essentially the consumer AI 
2700.32 - 2704.32: division of Microsoft but they did give 
2701.84 - 2706.64: him the CEO title for background 
2704.32 - 2708.68: inflection have raised 1.5 billion over 
2706.64 - 2711.24: the last two years it was one of these 
2708.68 - 2714.56: giant fundings that occurred to build a,
2683.68 - 2687.72: including the CEO Mustafa who everybody 
2686.52 - 2690.08: knows I just actually had him on this 
2687.72 - 2691.80: week in startups he was the co-founder 
2690.08 - 2695.20: of deep mind he worked at Google for 
2691.80 - 2698.32: years and now he's going to be the CEO 
2695.20 - 2700.32: of a new company called Microsoft AI,
2668.92 - 2673.28: keep the train moving here the AI 
2670.96 - 2675.88: landscape shifting yet again Microsoft 
2673.28 - 2678.00: just just did another one of these 
2675.88 - 2681.20: shadow Aqua hires this time of 
2678.00 - 2683.68: inflection AI bizarre deal Microsoft has 
2681.20 - 2686.52: hired most of the team at inflection AI,
2657.48 - 2661.28: forestry around it all I got to do is 
2659.84 - 2662.28: say something something landfills 
2661.28 - 2664.24: everyone will love them again they can 
2662.28 - 2665.84: charge ABS absolutely virtual signaling 
2664.24 - 2668.92: right they can genu something something 
2665.84 - 2670.96: landfills yes absolutely all right let's,
2645.20 - 2647.92: got to do is put out a cringe ad talking 
2646.80 - 2649.64: about the environment everyone's going 
2647.92 - 2652.24: to love him again absolutely they should 
2649.64 - 2655.36: do an ad where they have a diverse cast 
2652.24 - 2657.48: of people and that diverse cast could 
2655.36 - 2659.84: talk about like putting sustainable,
2632.40 - 2636.84: better deal you would be getting paid 
2634.44 - 2638.92: for the actual performance so anyway 
2636.84 - 2640.96: really you know Jal I have an idea for 
2638.92 - 2643.64: the National Association of Realtors oh 
2640.96 - 2645.20: here we go if they want to stop being 
2643.64 - 2646.80: perceived as an evil monopolist all they,
2618.32 - 2624.16: you said 1% up to a million so that's 
2620.48 - 2627.16: 10K and then 10% for the next 100K and 
2624.16 - 2629.08: then 20% for the next 100K so you you 
2627.16 - 2630.80: know that 1.2 million is really hard to 
2629.08 - 2632.40: get yeah I'll give you 20% of that 
2630.80 - 2634.44: incremental 100 that would be a much,
2603.24 - 2609.04: person the incentive comp should be 
2605.84 - 2611.08: variable based on performance whereas 
2609.04 - 2612.88: the guaranteed part of the comp should 
2611.08 - 2615.88: be like you said a flat fee it's kind of 
2612.88 - 2618.32: like the salesperson has an OT right Bas 
2615.88 - 2620.48: variable yeah I mean you could say if,
2588.92 - 2593.48: compensated for the whole thing yeah for 
2591.80 - 2595.64: the whole thing get compensated no 
2593.48 - 2596.96: matter should be that you get a flat 
2595.64 - 2599.64: rate 
2596.96 - 2601.48: $10,000 at a million and then you get 
2599.64 - 2603.24: 10% over a million or something you 
2601.48 - 2605.84: could give just like you with a sales,
2574.32 - 2580.44: that a bad sale of your home would be 
2577.88 - 2582.92: let's call it 900,000 or a million and a 
2580.44 - 2585.48: great sale would be 1.2 so exactly 
2582.92 - 2587.00: there's a very small margin where they 
2585.48 - 2588.92: actually have an impact based on the 
2587.00 - 2591.80: quality of their effort but they get,
2557.36 - 2562.96: selling it for a million one so I've 
2559.44 - 2566.60: made a $100,000 profit but I got to pay 
2562.96 - 2569.24: $60,000 of my total growth to an agent 
2566.60 - 2571.64: to sell it for me% profit I just gave up 
2569.24 - 2574.32: 60% of my profit on my home right it 
2571.64 - 2577.88: makes no sense and the crazy thing is,
2544.44 - 2549.72: 6% might put them underwater so if it's 
2547.64 - 2551.04: now now down to two or three totally 
2549.72 - 2552.96: yeah people might be like it's always 
2551.04 - 2555.84: been crazy to me that anyone would pay a 
2552.96 - 2557.36: percent of absolute value it makes no 
2555.84 - 2559.44: sense I bought a home for a million I'm,
2532.56 - 2536.40: to make these services available direct 
2534.32 - 2537.12: to Consumers without needing an agent 
2536.40 - 2538.32: and they're going to be pretty 
2537.12 - 2541.00: compelling services and they're going to 
2538.32 - 2543.36: show up real fast I mean a lot of people 
2541.00 - 2544.44: will not list their home or sell it 
2543.36 - 2547.64: because that,
2522.24 - 2524.88: yeah and I think it's a great 
2523.24 - 2526.00: opportunity for startups I'll say this 
2524.88 - 2527.52: right now like I think there's going to 
2526.00 - 2529.60: be a lot of startups that are going to 
2527.52 - 2532.56: come out of this ruling that are going 
2529.60 - 2534.32: to launch allart Services leveraging AI,
2506.68 - 2512.12: so now the sellers agent has 3% more 
2512.24 - 2516.24: that yeah but net net I think it's good 
2514.72 - 2518.20: for buyers and sellers because the 
2516.24 - 2519.88: transaction cost of TR tring go down 
2518.20 - 2522.24: exactly money goes back in consumers 
2519.88 - 2523.24: Pockets yeah create a more fluid Market,
2493.64 - 2498.28: then that's $100,000 they can't pay less 
2496.32 - 2500.16: than they can pay for the house itself 
2498.28 - 2501.92: because they have to pay an agent so it 
2500.16 - 2503.56: all comes back into home prices no it 
2501.92 - 2506.68: Nets out because the sellers agents no 
2503.56 - 2512.12: longer paying 6% they're paying 3% and,
2479.88 - 2484.84: doing that J $200 an hour $300 an hour 
2482.48 - 2486.72: doesn't this impact home prices as well 
2484.84 - 2488.84: like if you if the buyer had to pay all 
2486.72 - 2490.68: of a sudden their affordability 
2488.84 - 2493.64: effectively goes down because if they 
2490.68 - 2496.32: have to pay an extra $100,000 for a home,
2470.20 - 2474.00: buyers should be responsible for paying 
2471.76 - 2475.32: their own Brokers and if you do that I 
2474.00 - 2476.84: think you'll knock out half the fees of 
2475.32 - 2478.36: this industry here's an idea why they 
2476.84 - 2479.88: let them charge an hourly fee as a 
2478.36 - 2482.48: buyer's agent like there will be people,
2457.56 - 2461.60: industry if buyers are forced to pay 
2459.20 - 2463.80: their own commissions uh their own like 
2461.60 - 2465.56: buy side Brokers commission and in the 
2463.80 - 2466.84: Articles they're saying there's still 
2465.56 - 2470.20: like some gray area about what's going 
2466.84 - 2471.76: to happen but that is what should happen,
2444.40 - 2448.76: is like protect it's like a racket 
2446.40 - 2450.44: that's protected some it's cracked yeah 
2448.76 - 2452.76: well I I still am like a little bit 
2450.44 - 2454.80: skeptical that this is going to work out 
2452.76 - 2457.56: exactly the way we're saying because it 
2454.80 - 2459.20: is just such a a death blow to the,Your task is to summarize the content by providing a relevant title, writing an introductory paragraph explaining the high-level context of the content, and at least 5 bulletpoints in a list highlighting the main topics or chapters in the content (with 1-2 sentences describing each). \n Respond using markdown and the following markdown template and nothing else (no references).
