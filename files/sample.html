  <h2>AI Video Processing Techniques</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Object Detection</li>
    <p>
      Object detection algorithms enable the identification and tracking of objects within a video. This is useful for applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and video analytics.
    </p>
    <li>Video Compression</li>
    <p>
      AI-based video compression techniques leverage machine learning models to reduce the size of video files without significant loss in quality. This enables efficient storage and transmission of video content.
    </p>
  </ol>

  <h2>AI Video Processing Code Example</h2>
  <pre><code>
    const video = document.getElementById('video');

    function processVideo() {
      // AI video processing code goes here
    }

    video.addEventListener('play', processVideo);
  </code></pre>
