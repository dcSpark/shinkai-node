# Quick Start Guide for Windows

## Prerequisites

To build this project on Windows, you will need the following:

- Rust
- OpenSSL development libraries

## Installing Dependencies

### 1. Install Rust

Download and install Rust via `rustup` by running the following command in **PowerShell**:

```powershell
iwr https://sh.rustup.rs -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

Follow the prompts to install Rust and configure your environment.

Verify installation:

```powershell
rustc --version
```

### 2. Install OpenSSL Development Libraries

On Windows, the easiest way to get OpenSSL is through [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). Follow these steps:

1. Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
   .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   ```

2. Install OpenSSL using vcpkg:

   ```powershell
   .\vcpkg\vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows
   ```

3. Set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable to the vcpkg installation path:
   ```powershell
   $env:OPENSSL_DIR = "C:\path\to\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows"
   $env:PKG_CONFIG_PATH = "$env:OPENSSL_DIR\lib\pkgconfig"
   ```

### 3. Build the Project

Once all dependencies are installed, build the project with:

```powershell
cargo build
```

## Alternative Installation

For a smoother developer experience, setup WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and install a Linux distribution.

### 1. Install WSL

Run the following command to install Ubuntu as the default distribution:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

Or run the following command to change the distribution installed:

```powershell
wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>
```

### 2. Install Shinkai Node

Enter the following command to step inside the installed Linux distribution:

```powershell
wsl
```

Follow the instructions in the **Quick Start Guide for Linux** documentation to install Shinkai Node in a Linux environment.
