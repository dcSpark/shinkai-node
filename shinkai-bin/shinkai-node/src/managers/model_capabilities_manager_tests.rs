                "Summarize this: CARING FOR PLANTS Thinking Like A Plant One way to come up with \
                good research questions and to care for your plants well is to try thinking about \
                what it’s like to be a plant. Plants are sessile: they can determine which direction \
                to grow in but are otherwise stuck in place. Even though plants can’t move around, \
                they must still survive the challenges of weather, air, soil, amount and quality of \
                water, neighboring plants, diseases, and many kinds of herbivores, both above ground \
                and below. I wish it would rain! Above ground, most tissues help the plant collect \
                light for photosynthesis. Stems, woody trunks, and branches lift some plants above \
                their neighbors to place their leaves in the best and brightest sunlight. Other plants \
                have leaves that are adapted to use lower amounts of sunlight. Leaves, and sometimes \
                stems, contain pores called stomata that let carbon dioxide into the plant for \
                photosynthesis and let extra oxygen out. Stomata also allow water vapor out of a plant, \
                and when it is hot, dry, or windy, plants can close their stomata to limit water loss. \
                A plant’s underground world affects its survival as well. Most land plants take up nearly \
                all of their water from the soil. Plant roots also take up inorganic nutrients such as \
                nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, and about a dozen micronutrients, elements that plants \
                need in very small doses for survival and growth. Some plants can grow in soil containing \
                a lot of salt, very high or very low pH, or large amounts of metals toxic to other organisms. \
                Most plants, however, are sensitive to these and other factors – their roots may take up \
                whatever gets put into the soil, directly or by the flow of contaminated groundwater. \
                Thought Exercise: Based on the above information, what environmental factors do you think \
                can help a plant grow well? What factors might prevent it from growing well? Does it depend \
                on the species of the plant? Many organisms affect plants in ways that can be helpful or \
                harmful. Plants with showy flowers usually depend on pollinators to make seeds. Most plants \
                can form a symbiosis with fungi, providing carbon in exchange for mineral nutrients like \
                phosphorus. Legumes, like beans and peas, form symbioses with bacteria that can directly \
                provide nitrogen to the plant. Earthworms can aerate dense soil as they move, making it easier \
                for roots to grow through it. Earthworms also help break down organic matter to release soil \
                nutrients, making them easier for plants to take up. In contrast, herbivores and parasites may \
                attack and eat plants above or belowground. Plants also get diseases, although the bacteria and \
                viruses that cause plant infections are very different from those that cause illness in humans. \
                To help ward off these dangers, plants have several types of defenses. Sometimes these defenses, \
                which include poisons and sharp thorns can be harmful to humans. You can learn more about these \
                defenses and how to limit your risk of being harmed by the plants you work with in Investigating \
                Plants Safely. Thought experiment: What are some ways we can limit the presence of organisms that \
                damage or sicken plants? If we use these methods, will we affect the organisms that are helpful to \
                plants? What Do Plants Need to Survive? overwatering them! Plants can be drowned, just like animals, \
                if their roots are underwater and cut off from oxygen too long. Plants Need Water: The main type of \
                care plants need to grow well is regular watering. In nature, plants depend on rainfall for their \
                water, so the local climate affects which plants will be able to survive and reproduce in the wild. \
                In farm fields, gardens, and indoors, humans can provide plants with water. Even so, the leading \
                cause of death in houseplants is actually What Do Plants Need to Survive? More is Not Always Better! \
                are growing a plant indoors that depends on an insect or animal for pollination, you will have to \
                pollinate it by hand. If you will be growing plants through a full life cycle, it is important to \
                know how they reproduce. You may find it difficult to get seeds from plants that mainly reproduce \
                asexually, but it might be much easier to get tubers, stolons, or plantlets. If your plant is \
                wind-pollinated, placing a fan near the flowers may be enough to cause pollination and set seed \
                indoors. If you grow both roots and shoots at new nodes. Some plants produce underground storage \
                structures, like garlic bulbs or potato tubers, which may later grow roots and shoots. entirely \
                without seeds. They may not flower at all, but instead produce plantlets along leaf edges that \
                can break off and root in the place where they fall. Plants like strawberries can reproduce through \
                stolons, stems that grow along the ground occasionally Growing Your Own Seeds: Plants survive from \
                generation to generation by both sexual and asexual reproduction. Some flowers can be wind \
                pollinated, while others need insects or birds to transfer pollen and fertilize the ovules. \
                Fertilized ovules develop into seeds, which can be dispersed in an incredible number of ways. In \
                contrast, some plants reproduce asexually – partly or Thought Exercise: Why do you think that plants \
                need more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium compared to most other nutrients? What micronutrients \
                do you think plants might need? fertilizers now available can act as the basis for a wide range of \
                experiments! artificial fertilizers, so they can help support beneficial soil fungi and bacteria. \
                Chemical fertilizers can release nutrient levels that become toxic to these organisms. Common \
                examples of organic fertilizers include compost, fish fertilizer, and bone meal. Compost and fish \
                fertilizer tend to be high in nitrogen, while bone meal is high in phosphorus. The large variety of \
                Organic fertilizers also add nutrients to the soil, but the quantities of these nutrients are often \
                not as precisely known. They can still be described in N- P-K ratios, however. Whether stated in the \
                product or not, most contain a variety of micronutrients, because organic fertilizers come from \
                biological sources. They have the advantage of containing more carbon than most experiments lasting \
                a few days to a few weeks, though, an “all purpose” fertilizer or one with a 10-10-10 formulation will \

                ones and how much of each are present. Special, fine- tuned fertilizer formulations for flowers, \
                vegetables, and even African violets are now available for purchase. Some brands have one type of \
                fertilizer for a plant’s growth phase and another type for flowering and fruiting. For Chemical \
                fertilizers may provide only the major plant nutrients of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. As \
                shorthand, bags of fertilizer are often sold with “N-P-K” values listed on the front. A listing of \
                5-1-1, for example, means that five units of nitrogen and one each of phosphorus and potassium are \
                found in a given amount of fertilizer. Some fertilizers also contain weeks or months. Time- release \
                fertilizers are useful for experiments lasting more than six weeks, while shorter experiments can \
                use liquid or soluble fertilizers. Many kinds of fertilizer can be used for indoor and outdoor \
                gardening. The two basic categories are chemical and organic fertilizers. Chemical fertilizers will \
                provide very precise quantities of known nutrients to the soil. They may come in a liquid form, a \
                solid that you dissolve in water, or as sticks or pellets that you place into the soil to release \
                nutrients over several plant has more nutrients available than it needs! Very short experiments, \
                like those that will take one hour to three days of class, will not need any fertilizer. Little growth \
                occurs over that amount of time. On the other hand, experiments lasting a week or longer will benefit \
                from a fertilizer if it is not already mixed into the soil. Roots Take Up Nutrients: Nutrients support \
                plant growth and development, and they can be provided in a fertilizer. Whether or not you need to use \
                fertilizer depends on several factors. Some potting soils already include fertilizer. You will not need \
                to add any extra fertilizer to grow plants in this type of soil unless you plan to carry out an experiment \
                on what happens when a unexplored territory. The best solution is to transplant the plant to a larger pot. \
                If you decide to transplant your plant, remember to be gentle – you want to avoid removing any roots. After \
                you are done transplanting, water the plant in its new, larger container right away. You should limit other \
                environmental changes for a few days to help prevent transplant shock. Finally, for experiments that will \
                take longer than two months, you should think about whether the plants may become rootbound in their pots. \
                Plant roots continue growing as long as a living plant is not dormant. For fast- growing or large plants, \
                roots can begin to grow in circles around the pot edges or even peek out of the holes on the bottom, \
                searching for routes to one or more drainage holes in the bottom. These let out any extra water from rain or \
                hand-watering. Next, since roots respire, it is important that oxygen be able to reach them. Mixing some \
                light, fluffy material like vermiculite or perlite with the darker organic matter makes potting soil more \
                porous. These lighter materials can act as pools of root-sustaining oxygen even when the soil is soaking wet. \
                To prevent roots from drowning, it is also important to use pots that have between each watering. helpful. \
                Soil is a bit hydrophobic until it absorbs a little water, so putting dry soil into a pot and adding water \
                from the top may leave dry spots below the surface. Adding just enough water to the soil so that it has a \
                spongy, cake-like consistency will make the soil just wet enough to easily absorb liquid during top-watering, \
                even if the top layer of soil dries completely One of the easiest ways to grow a plant indoors is to put some \
                potting soil into a container and then bury the plant roots (or a seed) in the soil. This sounds simple, but \
                a few small tricks can help support the plant or seed early on, easing transplant shock or allowing a seed to \
                sprout more quickly. First, mixing some water into the soil before placing it in a pot can be new places \
                underground, discovering new sources of water and nutrients. If you test different types of rooting materials \

                of a pond, while others may creep into the crevices in bare rock! If you have ever looked closely, you may have \
                seen plants rooted in discarded cloth or in the tiny “rocks” of a softball field. While roots hold a plant in \
                place, they also explore new territory as they grow. Even when a plant does not appear to be growing above \
                ground, plant roots may be growing into Plant Roots Need to Explore: Plants can root themselves in a surprising \
                variety of materials. Crop plants can usually grow in sandy or clay-filled soils, even if they grow best in \
                loamy soils. Some wild species grow roots in the muck at the Electricity flows to the light when the timer is \
                in the light period, but it is cut off during the dark period. (<10 h of light). If you use only natural \
                lighting, the time of year that you carry out an experiment can affect whether or not a plant blooms. \
                Artificial lighting can be used to change the photoperiod if you add a timer. Most light timers can be plugged \
                into an outlet, then set to turn on and off at specific times. The artificial light source is then plugged into \
                the timer. Plants also adjust their growth and time their flowering based on the time of day and time of year. \
                They can sense the number of hours of light in each day – the photoperiod. Providing the same species of plant \
                with two different photoperiods can give very different results. For example, some plants require long days (>14 \
                h of light) to flower, while others need short days preferences. You might want to test different types of \
                lighting to see if any differences are big enough to affect your favorite species. Thought Exercise: Which \
                colors of light do you think might cause the best growth in your favorite type of plant? Do you think growth is \

                in cost, energy efficiency, bulb life, heat produced, and spectrum. Regular home or office incandescent or \
                fluorescent bulbs have different spectra from light bulbs made for plant growth, so they may not be as effective \
                for growing plants. Plants can also vary strongly in their lighting The color spectrum of artificial lighting \
                can influence how well a plant grows indoors. The spectrum used to measure PPFD runs from 400 – 700 nm, from \
                near-UV to far-red, because plants only use this range of the spectrum. Artificial plant lighting comes in \
                several varieties, including full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs, metal halide bulbs, and colored LED lighting. \

                but they may grow better with some extra light. Full sunlight in summer at noon has a PPFD of about 2000 µmol \
                photons/m2/s, varying based on how far from the equator it is measured. Plants that grow in full sun, such as \
                crop plants, benefit from high PPFD and need artificial lighting to grow their best indoors. We need only about \
                20-50 µmol/m2/s to see well, so even shade-loving plants benefit from lower-intensity Plants Need Light: Light \
                is critical for plants to make sugars through photosynthesis. Plants also use light to judge the time of day and \
                year. For these reasons, lighting can influence plant growth, dormancy, and flowering. Light intensity, usually \
                measured as photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), is a measure of how much incoming light is available for \
                photosynthesis. Water from a kitchen or lab faucet is clean enough for the majority of plants. • Potted plants \
                should be given enough water so that the soil is fully soaked and some water runs out the bottom of the pot. \
                Empty out any extra water from the dish beneath the pot after watering. • The plant should usually not be watered \
                again until the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. It wasn’t long before I noticed the leaves had begun to \
                wilt and no new flowers were budding. If the leaves are wilting, I thought, the geranium must need more water! \
                I added another watering just before bedtime. Unfortunately, the extra water didn’t help. By the end of the month \
                the plant was dead! A few tips can help you keep your plants healthy as you water them: “OK,” I said, “I’ll start \
                right away.” I immediately watered the plant. The first thing I did the next morning was water it again, and I \
                re-watered it that night after supper. For the next several weeks I continued this tender loving care, watering \
                the geranium every morning and every night. I gave my mother a potted geranium last Mother’s Day. It had lots of \
                big red flowers standing tall above dozens of thick, velvety leaves. It was beautiful, and she really liked it. \
                “This is such a lovely gift,” she said. “Why don’t you take care of it for me?” More is Not Always Better! The Next \
                Best Thing to Nature…is Nature? Botanists have long used small paintbrushes to move pollen from one flower to \
                another. This kind of tool is important for controlled crosses, a breeding method in which both parents are \
                chosen to produce seed. More recently, some botanists began to try a more “natural” tool for hand-pollinating \
                flowers. The bodies of dead honeybees can be made into bee sticks by attaching them to small handles, such as \
                toothpicks. Bee sticks give better results than paintbrushes. In fact, they work so well that astronauts have used \
                them to pollinate plants during experiments in space! Different Species Have Different Tastes: different \
                environments and have very different watering needs. Looking up basic information on You now have some general \
                guidelines on how to care for plants. Always keep in mind, though, that different species have evolved differently \
                and thrive in environments that may be very different from each other. Caring for a cactus the way that you would \
                care for a tomato plant will most likely kill the cactus, and the reverse is also true! Tomatoes and cacti are \
                adapted to cultivation of or, for wild plants, the habitat of the plant you plan to work with can be a great way to \
                fine-tune the guidelines described here. Environmental Treatments for Plant Experiments should a treatment mixture \
                be to mimic beach sand or seawater? How do you measure how salty a liquid is? Far from shore, most plants cannot \
                tolerate much sodium in the soil. Even high levels of plant nutrients like potassium can “burn” plant leaves. You \
                may want to carry out a salt tolerance experiment on seaside or inland plants, but figuring out how to treat your \
                plants is tricky. Should you mix table salt with the potting soil? Spray salt water on the leaves? How salty \
                salinity both on their leaves and in the soil in which they have rooted. Some plants can even use the ocean as a \
                primary water source! Changing Soil Salinity: If your family has ever spent time at the ocean shore, you may have \
                noticed that your car was covered with a fine layer of salt when you returned. Ocean spray can pass through the air \
                as a fine mist and deposit salts in the surrounding environment as the water evaporates. If plants are to survive \
                near the ocean, they must be able to deal with this high Thought Exercise: Your class may not have a light meter \
                available. What other ways could you measure or estimate the amount of light in your treatments? Your class might \
                have a light meter you can use to measure the intensity of the light that reaches the plants. This is the best way \

                treatment. Colored filters are also available if you wish to test the effect of different light wavelengths on plant \
                growth. You could also use white, gray, or black cotton cloth to reduce the amount of light that reaches the plant. \
                Folding over the cloth to form layers will more strongly limit the light intensity the plant gets. With this \
                Adjustable-intensity plant lighting does exist, but it is usually costly. Less expensive alternatives might be useful. \
                For example, filters for theater lighting could be easily placed between the light source and your plants. These \
                filters are carefully designed to allow a certain percentage of light to pass through, so you will know precisely how \
                much shade you have created Instead of growing some plants under LED lights and others under regular classroom \
                lighting, a better experiment would grow all plants under the same type of LED lights, but change the intensity of \
                one set of lights. Creating Shade for Plants: Reducing the light intensity that plants receive is simpler than \
                creating total darkness. This would be an indoor way to test the difference between a sunny climate and a cloudy one, \
                or compare an open prairie to the forest floor. In a well-designed experiment, the light source for all plants should \
                ideally be the same even if the intensity differs. turning out the classroom lights before opening a closet or closed \
                box to check on the plants would also limit their light exposure. experiment on extremely short photoperiods instead \
                of darkness! Therefore, you need to think about how to limit disruptions to your darkness treatment, and to your \
                controls, during such an experiment. Giving all of the plants a little bit extra water at the start may let you wait \
                an extra day or two before exposing the plants to light for the next watering. With permission, How long plants are \
                exposed to light also matters. Placing your plants in the closet will minimize the amount of light they can use, \
                especially if nobody opens the closet door during the entire experiment. If the closet is opened twice each class \
                period to find and store classroom materials, though, the plants will be regularly exposed to light. You may end up \
                carrying out an If you wish to darken only some parts of a plant, wrapping individual leaves or stems in aluminum foil \
                may be one useful approach. However, allowing gas exchange in these leaves is still important. Making small “bags” \
                of black plastic around the plant parts you wish to darken may allow better air flow while still effectively blocking \
                out light. plant inside a thick-walled cardboard box and use electrical tape to block all gaps, holes, and weak or \
                broken edges. Scientists use multiple layers of aluminum foil to wrap a clear container or drape several folds of \
                black velvet cloth over a frame to block light from an experiment. To create total darkness, you cannot simply put \
                your plants in a closet in a room where lights are used, because light will often shine underneath the door. Even this \
                tiny amount of light can be enough to signal to plants the direction they should grow to carry out more photosynthesis, \
                or to tell a seedling it has broken above the soil surface. Instead, you could place your this reason, it is important \
                to think about how dark your experimental treatment needs to be. This is based on the question you are testing. If you \
                need to make sure that absolutely no light reaches the plant, the way you create darkness will be different than what \
                you would do to treat a plant with minimal light. How Dark is Dark? Since photosynthesis is the main way a plant \
                produces food, one factor you might want to test is removing the energy for photosynthesis – light. Because light is \
                so critical to their survival, plants can be extremely sensitive to even very short durations or very low intensities \
                of light. Young seedlings can be as light-sensitive as photographic film! For also have trouble figuring out ways to \
                set up the experimental treatment you want to test. In this section, several ideas are presented for creating certain \
                environmental treatments and telling how they compare to what plants must survive in the wild. You may already have \
                ideas about an environmental condition you wish to test. If it’s a condition such as the amount of water or kind of \
                fertilizer, you now have some information about how a control treatment might be set up differently from an \
                experimental treatment. However, a few plant species might respond to environmental factors that have not yet been \

                Treatments: Plants can be sensitive to a surprising array of environmental conditions. Temperature and humidity \
                can be relatively easy to change, for example. Such factors might be more likely to affect specialized species, \

                useful in an experiment lasting over six weeks. About 300 g/m2 of iron sulfate will reduce the pH by about 0.5 \
                units, as will 60 g/m2 of peat moss. 100 grams per square meter of soil, or g/m2) is often used to increase \
                both soil pH and potassium content. Pulverized agricultural lime, which consists of calcium and magnesium \
                carbonate, is another common choice; 170 g/m2 will raise the pH approximately 0.5 units. A rain! Nitric or \
                sulfuric acids are better choices if you wish to test the effect of acid rain on plants indoors. Alternatively, \
                soil amendments can be added to potting soil to change its pH. Just as hydrochloric acid is not the most realistic \
                choice for lowering pH, few gardeners would add potassium hydroxide pellets to raise the pH of an acidic soil. \
                Instead, wood ash (up to Theoretically, the pH of a solution can be changed for an experiment by adding any acid \
                or a base to the normal watering solution. Some acids and bases are better to use than others, though. Adding a \
                few drops of hydrochloric acid and monitoring the result with a pH meter will allow you to precisely lower the \

                while radishes prefer a soil pH between 6.0-6.5. Blueberries, which often grow wild in bogs, prefer even more \
                acidic soils and thrive in a soil pH of 4.0-5.0. Other plants, such as lilacs, prefer alkaline soils of pH 7.0-8.0. \
                Soil pH affects plants directly through the concentration of protons in the soil, but it can also change how easy \
                it is for roots to Tap water is healthy for most plants, and plants have survived for millennia on rainwater. Based \
                on this, do you think that a soil pH between 5.6 and 7.0 is well suited for plant growth? This is true for many \
                crops and garden plants. As for other environmental conditions, though, each species has a specific pH range \
                preference. For example, asparagus grows best with a soil pH water has a pH of about 7.0, while clean rainwater \
                contains some dissolved carbon dioxide and has a pH near 5.6. Acid rain contains dissolved sulfuric acid and \
                nitric acid from human and natural sources, so it has an even lower pH – 4.0 is typical, although some \
                thunderstorms in urban parts of the East Coast have had a pH as low as 2.0. Changing Soil pH: To measure how \
                acidic or basic a solution is, scientists use pH. A pH of 7 is considered to be neutral. A lower pH, between 0 \
                and 7, indicates greater acidity. A higher pH, up to 14, indicates greater alkalinity (basicity). Each one-unit \
                decrease of pH indicates the presence of ten times as many hydrogen ions or protons (H+) in a given volume of \
                solution. Pure houseplants’ or garden plants’ needs. In contrast, sodium is a plant micronutrient, so high \
                concentrations are difficult for plants to tolerate. To test the effects of salinity, scientists usually water \
                plants with different concentrations of salt water. Sodium chloride can be added to a regular fertilizer \
                solution, for example. While the fertilizer itself will also increase the solution’s conductivity, the nitrogen, \

                a conductivity of about 6-8 µS/m. Many garden stores sell handheld conductivity meters, which can often measure \
                pH as well. Measuring conductivity directly is useful if you wish to test the effects of salinity but expect \
                evaporation during an experiment lasting several days or weeks. most tap water has a salinity of 5-50 mS/m, \
                and distilled, deionized Salinity can be quantified as parts per thousand (‰), or the number of grams of salt \
                per kilogram of water. Today, scientists usually describe salinity in terms of a liquid solution’s ability to \
                conduct electricity, which is measured in Siemens per meter (S/m). Ocean water, which is salty enough to kill \
                most inland plants, has a salinity of 5 S/m, or 35‰. In contrast, high salt tolerance. Much of the land used \
                for agriculture is irrigated to ensure that crops have a consistent supply of water as they grow. In very dry \
                climates, some of this water quickly evaporates, leaving behind trace amounts of salt in the soil. Over many \
                seasons, regular irrigation can lead to soil salinization. As a result, some plant breeders are now trying to \
